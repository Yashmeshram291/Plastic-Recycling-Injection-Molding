# Fabrication of Plastic Recycling by Injection Molding Machine

## Objective
To design and fabricate a low-cost plastic recycling system that converts plastic pellets into molded components.

## Tools & Technologies
- Mechanical design and fabrication
- Heating coil and barrel system
- Injection molding die

## Process
1. Plastic pellets are fed into the top-mounted hopper.
2. Barrel is heated using a heating coil until plastic melts.
3. Molten plastic is injected into a die to form desired shapes.
4. Output is tested and refined for accuracy and efficiency.

## Outcome
- Successfully fabricated and tested prototype.
- Improved recycling efficiency on a small scale.
- Practical exposure to sustainable manufacturing.
